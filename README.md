# YubiKit for Android
**This is a pre-release version of YubiKit. Some of the specs and APIs may change in future releases so use this documentation and the library for prototyping and not for a public release. If you are an early adopter please provide detailed feedback about the design and issues you may find when using YubiKit.**

**YubiKit**  is an Android library provided Yubico to interact with YubiKeys. The library supports NFC-enabled and USB YubiKeys.

Please note, **YubiKit** consumes data from the token and translates to the application for further processing. **YubiKit** performs data validation for the purposes of creating valid responses to the application, however content/logical validation and security decisions are outside the scope of the **YubiKit** and must be handled by the application.

**YubiKit** is multi-module library with following components:

[Yubikit](./yubikit/README.md) provides an functionality to detect YubiKey plugged in or tapped over NFC,

[OATH](./oath/README.md) allows applications, such as an authenticator app, to store OATH TOTP and HOTP secrets on a YubiKey, and to retrieve one-time passwords

[OTP](./otp/README.md) provides classes to obtain Yubikey OTP

[PIV](./piv/README.md) provides implementation of Personal Identity Verification (PIV)

[MGMT](./management/README.md) provides subset of API for personal customization of YubiKey and HMAC-SHA1 challenge-response

All **YubiKit** modules has javadoc and sources deployed with the library archive. Use this documentation for a more detailed explanation of all the methods, properties and parameters from the API.

This library comes with a demo application named **YubikitDemo**. The application is implemented in Kotlin.
