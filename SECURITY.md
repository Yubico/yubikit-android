# Security
Yubico is committed to maintaining the security and privacy of our products, services, and customers.
We value the contributions of the security research community and have implemented a Coordinated Vulnerability
Disclosure process to handle vulnerability disclosures in a manner that protects the community while encouraging
responsible reporting.

# Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Yubico-owned repository, 	**please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests**, instead report it to us as described below.

* __Email Us__: Send details to **security@yubico.com** .  
  Include:
    - A description of the issue and steps to reproduce it.
    - Any supporting evidence (e.g., screenshots, proof of concept).
    - Any potential impact and your recommendations for mitigating the risk.
    - Your contact information (optional if you wish to remain anonymous).
* __Encrypt Sensitive Data__:  
  Use our PGP key at  __[Yubico-Security-Team-Public-Key](https://www.yubico.com/.well-known/Yubico-Security-Team-Public.asc)__ if needed.
* __Act Responsibly__: We request that you not share information about a potential vulnerability with others until we have had a chance to triage and if needed, provide mitigation to impacted customers.

# Our Process
* __Confirmation__: We will confirm receipt of the report within 3 business days.
* __Triage__: We will work with you to validate and resolve the issue.
* __Disclosure__: We will notify you when the fix is complete and may coordinate public disclosure timelines, if applicable.
* __Acknowledgement__: If desired, we will acknowledge your contribution as part of the disclosure process.

# Safe Harbor
Yubico will not pursue or support any legal action related to the research and disclosure of vulnerability when those activities follow Yubicoâ€™s coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy and process.
